# Hi there! 👋

## About Me

I'm a developer who enjoys exploring code and building things. I believe in learning by doing and sharing what I discover along the way.

🔨 I work on projects that interest me and solve real problems

💭 I'm curious about new technologies and always open to learning

🤝 I enjoy collaborating with others and contributing to meaningful projects

📍 Based in Binangonan, Calabarzon, Philippines

## What I'm Up To

Right now, I'm focused on building practical projects and improving my craft. I code when inspiration strikes and enjoy the process of creating something from nothing.

## My Approach

I don't follow rigid learning paths or chase every trending framework. Instead, I:

- Build projects that genuinely interest me
- Learn what I need when I need it
- Focus on understanding fundamentals over collecting badges
- Contribute when I have something meaningful to add
- Keep things simple and practical

## Projects

Check out my repositories to see what I've been working on. Each project represents something I found interesting or useful enough to build.
